# A collection of scripts for analysing and extracting data from output files

This directory contains a collection of scripts that can be used to analyse and extract data from output files generated by various computational chemistry software. Some scripts are explained in more detail in the tutorials section of the repository.

## Scripts

- [`gaussian_data.py`](gaussian_data.py): Extracts data from Gaussian output files and prints it to the terminal.
- [`gaussian_to_csv.py`](gaussian_to_csv.py): Extracts data from all Gaussian output files in the `cwd` and writes it to a `.csv` file.
- [`mep_jmol`](mep_jmol): Generates a Jmol script for visualising a molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface. This script is used in the [MEP tutorial](../../tutorials/MEP/README.md).
- [`myfunctions.py`](myfunctions.py): Contains a collection of functions used in the two gaussian scripts.
- [`spyrmsd_filter.py`](spyrmsd_filter.py): Filters conformers based on symmetry corrected RMSD. This script is used in the [CREST tutorial](../../tutorials/CREST/README.md#symmetry-corrected-rmsd).
