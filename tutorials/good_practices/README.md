# Genera Good Practicies guidelines - TRG

## Project structure

The use of a clear and consistent naming convention for foldes and files is crucial for a project research.
Establish a hierarchical folder structure for your projects and use always the same template when starting a new project.

You can find a suggested template below that can be used for all your projects or you can create your own project structure.

```
project_template
  ├── calculations
  |     ├── group_1
  |     |     ├── conf_analysis
  |     |     ├── opt
  |     |     ├── nbo_analysis
  |     |     ├── [...]
  |     |     └── single_points
  |     ├── [...]
  |     └── group_n
  ├── documents
  ├── figures 
  ├── literature 
  ├── paper 
  └── scripts 
```

Version control (e.g. git) is recommended for tracking changes in the code and documents

## Writing papers and report sharing 

### Internal reports and presentations

- Internal reports, datasets and presentations should be done/allocated using collaboration tools (e.g. Google Drive, Onedrive). 

- An example document with a generic report format can be found [here]().

### Papers and reviews

- The prefered way of writing scientific articles within the group would be using the Overleaf platform, as it offers read-time collaboration and LaTeX support.
    - If you are not familiar with Overleaf or LaTeX, you can learn the basics [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
- The prefered way to manage the Supporting Informatio of the papers within the group would be [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) as it allows to upload all the required documents, xyz structures, tables and figures as individual files that the reader can quickly download and access.

## General good practices 

### Data Management 
- Regurlarly backup your work including data, code, and documents. 
**Weekly backups** are highly recommended.
- Use either cloud storage or an institutional server for secure and accesible backups
- Keep software and systems updated to address security vulnerabilities
- Keep a detailed journal of all your projects, including: 
    - List of calculations and their state
    - TODO list
    - Computational details of the different parts of the project

    Having a consistent system would be recommended and some available options are:
    - Physical notebooks for different projects
    - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) 
    - [Notion](https://notion.so) 
    - [insert more options here]

### Code and Software
- Document your code comprehensively, including comments, function descriptions and usage instructions.
- Use version control for tracking code changes with clear commit messages
- A compilation of scripts used by the group can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/Trujillo-Group/trujillo_group_resources/tree/main/scripts), feel free to contribute and add your own scripts.

### Communication and Meetings
- Participate actively in research group meetings, sharing progress and challenges.
- Manintain open and clear communication with your supervisor and fellow researchers
- Use digital collaboration tools (e.g. Slack, Teams, etc.) for quick communications
