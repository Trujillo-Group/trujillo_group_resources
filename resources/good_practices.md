Welcome to the **Trujillo Research Group!** 
To ensure a productive and collaborative environment, we have established these guidelines for all PhD students to follow:

## General Good Practices

### 1. Data Management 
- Regularly backup your work, including data, code, and documents.
  **Weekly backups** are mandatory.
- Use either cloud storage or an institutional server for secure and accessible backups
- Keep software and systems updated to address security vulnerabilities
- Keep a detailed journal of all your projects, including: a list of calculations and their state, TODO list, and computational details.
- Be **extra** careful when using the command 'rm'. It is permanent and cannot be undone. In an attempt to save us from our own worst enemy, ourselves, it is recommended to use an alias such as srm='/bin/rm -i' as a safety net!
    *Suggested tools*:
    Physical notebooks,
    [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
    [Notion](https://notion.so).

### 2. Code and Software
- **Document your code** comprehensively, including comments, function descriptions and usage instructions.
- Use version control (e.g., GitHub) for tracking code changes with clear commit messages.
- List of recommended software:
  - **3D figures:**
    [CYLView](https://www.cylview.org/) (*free*),
    [Jmol](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/) (*open source*),
    [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) (*open source*),
    [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/),
    [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD) (*free*).
  - **Reaction schemes and 2D figures:**
    [Chemdraw](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html),
    [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (*open source*),
    [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/?gclid=CjwKCAjwjaWoBhAmEiwAXz8DBc2dkBvoIlDL4T8dlRXLb-6j0SriiyVhM1oOdaMV7o2kYxwaKsyDixoCc-EQAvD_BwE),
    [smiles2svg](https://github.com/iribirii/smiles2svg) (*open source*).
  - **3D modelling:**
    [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) (*open source*) combined with [molecular nodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes).
    
[Group GitHub repository](https://github.com/Trujillo-Group): Ensure your daily scripts are part of the group's GitHub repository.

Utilising and contributing to the [**scripts repository**](https://github.com/Trujillo-Group/trujillo_group_resources/tree/main/scripts) is highly recommended.
  
## 3. Project Organisation

- Maintain a **clear** and **consistent** naming convention for folders and files.
- Establish a hierarchical folder structure for your projects.
  Consider using the provided template or create your own.
  
```
project_template
  ├── calculations
  |     ├── group_1
  |     |     ├── conf_analysis
  |     |     ├── opt
  |     |     ├── nbo_analysis
  |     |     ├── [...]
  |     |     └── single_points
  |     ├── [...]
  |     └── group_n
  ├── documents
  ├── figures 
  ├── literature 
  ├── paper 
  └── scripts 
```

## Writing papers and report sharing 

### 4. Internal reports and presentations

- Use collaboration tools like **Google Drive** or **OneDrive** for creating and sharing internal reports, datasets, and presentations.

- *Example document*: refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBO9fovI7JyVLZ2LVy7tpVxf_777KzSQcyZJESrGJQ0/edit?usp=sharing) for a generic report format.

### 5. Papers and reviews

- Preferred platform for writing scientific articles: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) (offers real-time collaboration and LaTeX support).
- Manage Supporting Information on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), allowing easy access to readers.

 *Learning resources* If unfamiliar with Overleaf or LaTeX, you can learn basics [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)

## Communication and Meetings

### 6. Participation
- Actively participate in research group meetings, sharing your progress and challenges.
- Maintain open and clear communication with your supervisor and fellow researchers

### 7. Digital Collaboration Tools
- Use digital collaboration tools (e.g. Slack, Teams, etc.) for quick and efficient communications within the group, using the designated channels.
- Calendar Teams: keep track of the main events in the calendar (deadlines, meetings, etc.).

By adhering to these guidelines, you will contribute to a productive and harmonious research environment.
