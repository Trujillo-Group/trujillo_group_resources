## Blender
- [Blender guru donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLexwJr_iILK7IkuhEeAYeN7aLV5AAXKa-): This is a must for learning blender. Literally everyone in the community has done it.

- [Distrotube](https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube): pretty good videos if you are interested in learning more about linux. Just ignore his random political opinions in the middle of the video...
- [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz/video): more general UNIX content. Not active anymore.

## Inkscape: 

> [!NOTE]
> Once you are familiar with this, if you start using it frequently, I would recommend getting an Affinity designer license. 
> But this is good for learning.
